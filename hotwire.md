- Great drifting ruby intro video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVKRSF2Td7E&t=11m40s) (looks at turbo frames and some simple stimulus)
- Awesome video making a messages index view with form update with hotwire (turbo stream) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csvaYIaBYpw) (especially the first 10 mins or so)




### Random notes

- What's the difference between a [broadcast]() (as per the rails 7 demo video) and turbo_stream from the controller? 
  - ANS: use a broadcast when you want every browser with a certain page (e.g. multiple users with that particular page open) to receive an update. Regular turbo stream will update the *one* browser (i.e. the user's browser).
